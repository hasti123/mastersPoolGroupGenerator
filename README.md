# Masters Pool Group Generator
Currently this script generates all possible groups that you could choose for your Masters pool.

## How groups work
For most major tournaments you can sign up for a pool where you select a group of four players, each from a different rank group. 
You can pick one from group A, aka the top 10-12 players, and then group B, etc. 

## Possible ways of ranking groups
- Highest average ranking(from golf week and official world golf ranking)
- Most Masters tournament apperances
- Most Masters wins
- First alphabetically
